# Solace Kubernetes Deployment (with Operator) Overview

This project/folder contains a series of scripts that will help ease deployment tasks/activities in Kuberenetes or equivalent container platforms.

These scripts are created so you do not need to handcraft deployment yaml and instead only need to specify the correct values for all necessary variables.

The scripts are also meant to be used in multi-environment Ã— multi-broker deployment scenario.

The scripts are organized in a general cardinal order - please see file organization below.

# File Organization System

Scripts are prefixed with a 3-digit number system:

| Headers: | Category | Action | Sequence Number | 
| --------: | -------- | -------| --------------- |
| Explanation: | `0` Create/Deploy <br> `1` Delete/Remove | `0` Pre-deployment checks <br> `1` Pre-deployment actions <br> `2` Deployment actions <br> `5` Post-deployment configurations/steps <br> `6` Post-deployment checks/verification | This represents (but not necessary always true) the general sequence of steps to execute. Some steps might be optional depending on environment |

> [!NOTE]
> Delete/Remove Category will have Action in reversed order


# How to use

## Prepare configuration file(s)

1. Duplicate `sample` file in `env` folder to an appropriate name e.g. `dev` or `dev.dns.hostname`. This will be used as the `--env` identifier (might want to choose something simpler for less typing)
2. Fill in the values for the relevant variables - see below "Configuration Variables" for explanation

## New Deployment

1. Run `001-check-env.sh` to ensure all mandatory variables are filled, and the values are expected (some variables have default values to make things work)
2. Run `009-check-storage-class.sh` to ensure storage class satisfy Solace storage requirements.
3. Run `010-deploy-operator.sh` to deploy Solace Event Broker Operator
4. Run the scripts in this order - omit steps where not required:
   - `011-create-namespace.sh`
   - `012-create-secrets.sh`
   - `020-deploy-broker.sh`
   - `050-assert-leader.sh` (if HA deployment. Script will prompt either ways)
   - `051-load-server-cert.sh` (if SSL/TLS Certificates are not specified as part of deployment yaml)
   - `052-load-domain-certs.sh` (if required)
   - `059-execute-cli.sh`
   - `060-test-semp-login.sh`
   - `061-test-redundancy.sh`
   - `069-gather-configs.sh` (if you want to collect broker information and gather diagnostics)
  
## Redeployment / Delete Deployment

  1. Do the same as Step 1 & Step 2 as "New Deployment"
  2. Run the scripts in this order
     - `120-delete-broker.sh`
     - `112-delete-secrets.sh` (not required if you plan to execute `111-delete-namespace.sh`)
     - `111-delete-namespace.sh` (exercise caution as all resources e.g. pvc, secrets, deployments, services, etc. will be removed too)
